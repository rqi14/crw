## Short Answer

ScrapingBee is a solid rendering API, but per-credit pricing and lack of AI features push many teams to explore alternatives. Here's the quick breakdown:

- **CRW** — Best cost-effective alternative. Self-host for free on a $5 VPS, Firecrawl-compatible API, built-in MCP server. Zero per-request fees.
- **Firecrawl** — Best feature-complete alternative with markdown output, screenshots, and structured extraction.
- **Crawl4AI** — Best free Python alternative with AI extraction hooks.
- **ScraperAPI** — Best drop-in replacement with similar API design and proxy handling.
- **Bright Data** — Best for enterprise-grade proxy coverage at scale.
- **Apify** — Best for teams that want pre-built scrapers without custom code.
- **Zyte** — Best for automatic e-commerce data extraction.

## Why Look for ScrapingBee Alternatives?

ScrapingBee does one thing well: it renders JavaScript pages and returns HTML through a simple API. But that simplicity has limits:

- **Per-credit pricing:** Every request costs credits. For continuous workloads, costs grow linearly with no economy of scale.
- **Raw HTML output:** ScrapingBee returns rendered HTML, not markdown. For AI and LLM use cases, you need an additional conversion step.
- **No self-hosting:** Fully managed only. You can't run ScrapingBee on your own infrastructure to reduce costs.
- **No AI features:** No LLM extraction, no MCP server, no structured JSON output with schemas. If you're building AI agents or RAG pipelines, you need additional tooling on top.
- **No crawl endpoint:** ScrapingBee scrapes individual pages. Multi-page crawling and site mapping require orchestration on your side.

## 1. CRW — Best Cost-Effective Alternative

[CRW](https://github.com/us/crw) is a Rust-based scraping API that eliminates ScrapingBee's biggest limitation: per-request costs. Self-host CRW on a $5/month VPS and scrape unlimited pages with zero per-request fees. It also adds everything ScrapingBee lacks for AI use cases: markdown output, crawl endpoints, and a built-in MCP server.

### Why CRW Over ScrapingBee

- **Zero per-request fees:** Self-host for free. A $5/month VPS handles thousands of pages per day.
- **Markdown output:** Clean markdown ready for LLMs — no HTML-to-markdown conversion step needed.
- **Crawl and map endpoints:** Multi-page crawling and site mapping built in. ScrapingBee is single-page only.
- **Built-in MCP server:** AI agents get scraping tools immediately.
- **Firecrawl-compatible API:** Standard REST API that works with existing Firecrawl SDKs and integrations.
- **Local-first latency:** Run the engine next to your code instead of waiting on a remote rendering API round trip.

### Where ScrapingBee Is Still Better

- **JavaScript rendering:** ScrapingBee uses full Chromium — better for complex SPAs than CRW's LightPanda.
- **CAPTCHA solving:** Built-in CAPTCHA handling. CRW relies on stealth mode and proxy configuration.
- **Zero ops:** No server to manage, no Docker to run. Pay and scrape. CRW requires running a server (or using [fastCRW](https://fastcrw.com)).
- **Proxy network:** ScrapingBee includes proxy rotation. CRW requires configuring your own proxy provider.

**Best for:** Teams that want to eliminate per-request costs while gaining AI-specific features like markdown output and MCP integration.

## 2. Firecrawl — Best Feature-Complete Alternative

Firecrawl is everything ScrapingBee isn't: markdown output, crawl endpoints, structured extraction, screenshots, and PDF parsing. If you're leaving ScrapingBee because you need more features (not just lower cost), Firecrawl is the natural upgrade.

### Pros

- Clean markdown and structured JSON output
- Screenshots, PDF/DOCX parsing
- Crawl and map endpoints for multi-page workflows
- Self-hosted option (AGPL-3.0) to eliminate per-page fees
- Mature SDKs in Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust

### Cons

- Higher per-request latency than a local-first engine
- Self-hosting requires Redis, Playwright, and a heavier runtime
- Hosted pricing per page (similar cost structure to ScrapingBee)

**Best for:** Teams upgrading from ScrapingBee that need markdown, crawl endpoints, and extraction features. [CRW vs Firecrawl comparison](/blog/firecrawl-vs-crawl4ai-vs-crw).

## 3. Crawl4AI — Best Free Python Alternative

Crawl4AI is an open-source Python library for AI-focused web scraping. Like CRW, it eliminates per-request costs. Unlike CRW, it gives you Python hooks for custom extraction logic — at the cost of a heavier deployment.

### Pros

- Free and open source (Apache-2.0)
- Python-native with custom extraction hooks
- LLM-optimized chunking strategies
- Screenshot support via Playwright
- Good documentation for AI use cases

### Cons

- ~2 GB Docker image, 300 MB+ idle RAM — needs a $12+ VPS
- Python-only ecosystem
- REST server mode less polished than CRW or Firecrawl
- No Firecrawl-compatible API
- More complex setup than CRW

**Best for:** Python teams that want free, customizable AI extraction with full Playwright rendering. [CRW vs Crawl4AI](/blog/crw-vs-crawl4ai).

## 4. ScraperAPI — Best Drop-In Replacement

ScraperAPI is the closest direct competitor to ScrapingBee. Same concept: send a URL, get rendered HTML with automatic proxy rotation and CAPTCHA handling. If you're leaving ScrapingBee for pricing reasons but want the same basic service, ScraperAPI is worth comparing.

### Pros

- Very similar API to ScrapingBee — easy migration
- Automatic proxy rotation and geo-targeting
- CAPTCHA handling included
- Competitive pricing on higher tiers
- Structured data endpoints for Amazon, Google

### Cons

- Still per-request pricing — same fundamental cost structure as ScrapingBee
- No self-hosting option
- Raw HTML output, no markdown
- No AI-specific features (no MCP, no extraction)
- Single-page only, no crawl endpoints

**Best for:** Teams that want a ScrapingBee-like service with potentially better pricing or features for specific sites.

## 5. Bright Data — Best Enterprise Proxy Coverage

Bright Data is the largest proxy network (72M+ IPs). If you're leaving ScrapingBee because proxy rotation isn't good enough for your targets, Bright Data provides the most comprehensive IP coverage available.

### Pros

- 72M+ residential IPs across 195 countries
- Enterprise-grade anti-bot bypass
- Web Scraper IDE and pre-built datasets
- SOC 2 compliant with enterprise support
- Multiple proxy types: residential, datacenter, mobile, ISP

### Cons

- Expensive — enterprise pricing, minimum commitments
- Complex pricing model
- No self-hosting
- No markdown output or AI-specific features
- Overkill for most use cases that ScrapingBee handles

**Best for:** Enterprise teams scraping heavily protected sites that need maximum proxy coverage. [Bright Data alternatives](/blog/brightdata-alternatives).

## 6. Apify — Best Pre-Built Scraper Platform

Apify offers pre-built scrapers (Actors) for hundreds of specific websites. If you're leaving ScrapingBee because you're tired of parsing raw HTML yourself, Apify's marketplace gives you structured output for common targets.

### Pros

- Hundreds of pre-built scrapers for specific websites
- Structured output without custom parsing
- Managed infrastructure with scheduling
- Open-source Crawlee framework
- Built-in storage and datasets

### Cons

- Pay-per-compute pricing gets expensive
- Platform lock-in for Apify-specific features
- No Firecrawl-compatible API
- Overkill for simple scraping workflows

**Best for:** Teams that need pre-built scrapers for specific websites without writing extraction code. [Apify alternatives](/blog/apify-alternatives).

## 7. Zyte — Best for E-Commerce

Zyte provides automatic data extraction, especially strong for e-commerce. If you're using ScrapingBee to scrape product pages and writing custom parsers for each site, Zyte's automatic extraction handles layout changes for you.

### Pros

- Automatic product, article, and job listing extraction
- Handles layout changes without reconfiguration
- Built on Scrapy — mature crawl foundation
- Smart proxy rotation
- API and Scrapy plugin interfaces

### Cons

- Per-request pricing
- Focused on structured data, not general-purpose markdown
- No MCP server or AI agent features
- Less flexible for non-e-commerce use cases

**Best for:** E-commerce teams that need automatic product data extraction without maintaining custom parsers.

## Which ScrapingBee Alternative Should You Choose?

| Your Situation | Best Choice | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Want to eliminate per-request costs | **CRW** | $5/month VPS, unlimited scraping |
| Need markdown for AI/LLMs | **CRW** | Native markdown output, MCP server |
| Need screenshots + PDFs | **Firecrawl** | Most complete feature set |
| Python with custom extraction | **Crawl4AI** | Python hooks, free, open source |
| Same service, different provider | **ScraperAPI** | Similar API, competitive pricing |
| Enterprise proxy needs | **Bright Data** | Largest proxy network |
| Pre-built site scrapers | **Apify** | Actor marketplace |
| E-commerce product data | **Zyte** | Automatic extraction |

## The Cost Comparison

The biggest reason teams leave ScrapingBee is cost. Here's how the alternatives compare for a typical AI scraping workload of 10,000 pages per day:

- **ScrapingBee:** $49-149/month depending on plan and credit usage.
- **ScraperAPI:** $49-149/month — similar pricing structure.
- **CRW self-hosted:** $5/month (single VPS). Zero per-request fees. As a single small static binary, a $5 VPS handles this workload easily.
- **fastCRW cloud:** 1000 free credits to start, then usage-based — still significantly cheaper than ScrapingBee for most workloads.
- **Firecrawl self-hosted:** $12-24/month (VPS with enough RAM for Redis + Playwright).
- **Crawl4AI self-hosted:** $12-24/month (VPS with enough RAM for Python + Chromium).

Self-hosting changes the economics fundamentally. Instead of paying per request, you pay a fixed monthly cost that stays flat regardless of volume.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can CRW handle JavaScript-heavy sites like ScrapingBee?

CRW uses LightPanda for JavaScript rendering, which handles most sites but isn't at Chromium-level fidelity for complex SPAs. For heavily JavaScript-dependent sites, Firecrawl or Crawl4AI (both Playwright-based) are closer to ScrapingBee's rendering capability. CRW uses LightPanda for JS rendering, with Chrome as an optional fallback for complex SPAs (configurable, not automatic for all sites).

### Does CRW include proxy rotation like ScrapingBee?

CRW supports per-request proxy configuration (`PROXY_URL` environment variable or per-request parameter), but doesn't include a proxy pool. You bring your own proxy provider. For many AI scraping use cases targeting public content, proxies aren't needed at all.

### What's the simplest ScrapingBee replacement for AI use cases?

CRW. One Docker command to start, REST API for scraping, markdown output for LLMs, MCP server for AI agents. No proxy network, no platform, no marketplace — just a fast API that turns URLs into content.
