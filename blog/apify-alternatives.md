**Disclosure:** This roundup is written by the fastCRW team. fastCRW is included in the comparison below. We have tried to be accurate about competitor strengths and weaknesses; verify pricing and feature claims independently before making a purchasing decision.

## How we evaluated these tools

This isn't a vendor-blind shootout — we run fastCRW. To keep the comparison honest, every claim about a competitor is anchored in primary sources (their pricing page, docs, GitHub repo, or first-party announcements). Where we describe fastCRW's performance, we point to our public benchmark — full latency distribution and a one-command repro on AGPL-3.0 self-host (see [benchmark methodology](/benchmarks)) — rather than restating frozen numbers here. Where we cite competitor numbers, the source is linked inline. We do *not* publish head-to-head latency comparisons we haven't measured ourselves on the same hardware. Pricing and feature lists were last verified on 2026-05-11 — vendors change these often, so confirm before deciding.

## What changed in 2026 (read this first)

On 14 April 2026, Apify announced it would sunset rental Actor pricing within six months. Teams that depended on rental-tier Actors must either rebuild their integrations on Apify's standard pay-per-compute pricing, port to an Actor maintainer's own service, or move to an alternative platform. This post is for the third group.

If you're not affected by the rental pricing change and just want a faster, lighter, or cheaper scraper, the rest of this post still applies — the alternatives below were already valid choices before April.

## Short Answer

Apify is a powerful managed scraping platform with a deep Actor marketplace. After the rental pricing sunset, teams that liked the marketplace's "click-to-scrape" model are looking at three categories of alternatives: simpler scraping APIs, code-first scraping libraries, and enterprise proxy networks. Here's the quick breakdown:

- **fastCRW** — Best for AI agents. Firecrawl-compatible on the /scrape, /crawl, /map, /search overlap surface, built-in MCP server, single small Rust binary, local-first low latency, AGPL-3.0 self-host. The lightweight alternative to Apify's heavyweight platform.
- **Firecrawl** — Best feature-complete scraping API with screenshots, PDF parsing, and a mature SDK matrix (Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust). Self-host is a Docker Compose stack.
- **Crawl4AI** — Best for Python teams that want deep extraction customization. Apache-2.0 licensed; heavier footprint than fastCRW.
- **ScrapingBee** — Best simple rendering API with managed proxies and CAPTCHA solving.
- **Bright Data** — Best enterprise proxy network with the largest IP pool (72M+).
- **Octoparse** — Best no-code visual scraping tool for non-developers.
- **Zyte** — Best for e-commerce scraping with automatic data extraction.

## Why Look for Apify Alternatives?

Apify has real strengths — the Actor marketplace, managed infrastructure, and the open-source Crawlee framework. But several factors push teams to look elsewhere:

- **Rental Actor sunset (April 2026):** The 14 April announcement gave teams six months to migrate off rental pricing. Some Actor maintainers are absorbing the change; others are not. If your integration depends on a rental Actor whose maintainer isn't migrating, you need an alternative.
- **Cost at scale:** Pay-per-compute pricing means costs grow linearly with usage. For continuous scraping workloads, self-hosted tools like fastCRW are dramatically cheaper.
- **Platform lock-in:** Actors that use Apify-specific APIs (storage, queues, datasets) are hard to migrate. You're building on their platform, not your own.
- **Overkill for AI scraping:** Most AI agent and RAG use cases need "URL → markdown" — not a full scraping platform with marketplaces and cloud runtimes.
- **API design:** Apify has its own API design that does not match Firecrawl-style endpoints. Switching to or from Apify means rewriting client code; switching between Firecrawl-compatible tools is far cheaper.
- **JavaScript-first:** Crawlee (Apify's open-source framework) is JavaScript-first. Python or Rust teams need to maintain a separate runtime.

## 1. fastCRW — Best for AI Agent Scraping

[fastCRW](https://github.com/us/crw) is a Rust-based scraping and search server that takes the opposite approach from Apify. Instead of a full platform with marketplaces and cloud runtimes, fastCRW gives you a single statically-linked binary with a tiny idle footprint and fast cold start that turns URLs into clean markdown with low, local-first latency — see the full latency distribution and one-command repro on our [public benchmark](/benchmarks).

### Why fastCRW Over Apify

- **Purpose-built for AI:** Built-in MCP server (`crw_search`, `crw_scrape`, `crw_crawl`, `crw_map`, `crw_check_crawl_status`), markdown output optimized for LLMs, structured JSON extraction via `/v1/scrape` with `formats: ["json"]`. Designed for the use case most AI teams need.
- **Self-host for free:** One Docker command, tiny idle footprint, runs on a $5/month VPS. No per-request fees, no compute metering.
- **Firecrawl-compatible on overlap surface:** If you're moving off Apify but already had a Firecrawl-shaped client (LangChain's `FirecrawlLoader`, the official `firecrawl` Rust/JS SDKs), fastCRW accepts the same calls after a base-URL swap plus minor field-name and error-envelope adjustments. See the [compatibility matrix](https://github.com/us/crw/blob/main/COMPATIBILITY-firecrawl.md) for row-level diff.
- **No vendor lock-in:** Standard REST API. Your client code works with fastCRW, Firecrawl, or any compatible service.
- **Low local-first latency:** Runs next to your own workloads instead of going through Apify's cloud runtime — see the full latency distribution on our [public benchmark](/benchmarks).

### Where Apify Is Still Better

- **Pre-built scrapers:** Apify's marketplace had hundreds of Actors for specific websites (Amazon, LinkedIn, Google). fastCRW gives you a general-purpose API — you write the logic for specific sites. After the rental sunset, the marketplace's relative strength has narrowed but is still real for the standard pay-per-compute Actors.
- **Managed infrastructure:** Apify handles servers, scaling, and monitoring. With fastCRW, you manage the server (or use the [fastCRW Cloud](https://fastcrw.com) managed plan).
- **Browser automation:** Apify/Crawlee has mature Playwright integration for complex SPAs. fastCRW uses a lighter browser-fallback path that handles most sites but isn't at Playwright-level for complex interactions.
- **Data storage:** Apify provides datasets, key-value stores, and request queues. fastCRW is stateless — you store data in your own infrastructure.

**Best for:** AI agents, RAG pipelines, and teams that want a fast, lightweight scraping API without platform lock-in. For the deep 1:1 fastCRW vs Apify comparison see [Apify vs fastCRW: When to migrate (2026)](/alternatives/apify). For Rust-specific evaluation see [Firecrawl self-hosted Rust crate — two paths in 2026](/alternatives/firecrawl-self-hosted-rust).

## 2. Firecrawl — Best Feature-Complete API

Firecrawl is one of the most feature-rich scraping APIs on the market. If you're leaving Apify because you want a simpler API (not a simpler platform), Firecrawl gives you the same breadth of features in a cleaner REST interface.

### Pros

- Screenshots, PDF/DOCX parsing, structured extraction
- Mature SDKs in Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust
- Self-hosted option (AGPL-3.0)
- Cloud-only Fire-engine anti-bot for cloudflare-protected JS-heavy SPAs
- `/v1/agent` Spark models and `/v1/deep-research` on the Cloud surface
- Active development with regular releases

### Cons

- Higher per-request latency than a local-first Rust engine — see the head-to-head distribution on our [public benchmark](/benchmarks)
- Self-host is a Docker Compose stack: API + workers + Postgres + Redis, with a much larger memory baseline and slower cold start
- Hosted pricing per page adds up at scale ($83/mo Standard for 100k credits vs fastCRW $69/mo for 100k)

**Best for:** Teams that need a complete scraping API with features like screenshots, PDF parsing, or Fire-engine anti-bot. For the head-to-head see [Firecrawl alternative](/alternatives/firecrawl); for Rust-specific paths see [Firecrawl self-hosted Rust crate](/alternatives/firecrawl-self-hosted-rust).

## 3. Crawl4AI — Best Python Extraction Library

Crawl4AI is a Python scraping library focused on AI extraction. If you're leaving Apify because you want more control over extraction logic in Python, Crawl4AI gives you custom hooks, chunking strategies, and a Pythonic API. Apache-2.0 licensed (more permissive than AGPL-3.0).

### Pros

- Deep Python integration — extraction hooks in your language
- LLM-optimized chunking strategies
- Screenshot support via Playwright
- Apache-2.0 license
- Good documentation for AI use cases

### Cons

- ~2 GB Docker image, 300 MB+ idle RAM
- Python-only — no language-agnostic REST API as primary interface
- No Firecrawl-compatible API surface
- REST server mode less mature than the Python library
- No built-in horizontal scaling

**Best for:** Python teams that want custom extraction logic and don't mind the heavier footprint. For the head-to-head see [CRW vs Crawl4AI](/blog/crw-vs-crawl4ai).

## 4. ScrapingBee — Best Simple Rendering API

ScrapingBee takes the simplest possible approach: send a URL, get rendered HTML back. It handles browser rendering, proxy rotation, and CAPTCHAs behind a single endpoint. Much simpler than Apify for teams that don't need a full platform.

### Pros

- Extremely simple API — one endpoint for rendered HTML
- Built-in proxy rotation and CAPTCHA solving
- No infrastructure to manage
- Screenshot support
- Good JavaScript rendering

### Cons

- No self-hosting option
- Returns raw HTML, not markdown — conversion is your problem
- Per-credit pricing at scale
- No AI-specific features (no extraction, no MCP)
- No crawl or map endpoints — single pages only

**Best for:** Teams that just need rendered HTML from an API without the complexity of a scraping platform. See [ScrapingBee alternatives](/blog/scrapingbee-alternatives).

## 5. Bright Data — Best Enterprise Proxy Network

Bright Data is the largest proxy network provider (72M+ residential IPs). If you're leaving Apify because you need better proxy coverage or enterprise-grade anti-bot bypass, Bright Data is the next step up.

### Pros

- 72M+ residential IPs across 195 countries
- Enterprise-grade anti-bot bypass
- Web Scraper IDE for visual scraper building
- Pre-built datasets for common targets
- SOC 2 compliant, enterprise support contracts

### Cons

- Expensive — enterprise pricing with minimum commitments
- Complex pricing model (per GB, per request, per IP type)
- No self-hosting
- No Firecrawl-compatible API or MCP server
- Overkill for most AI scraping use cases

**Best for:** Enterprise teams that need massive proxy coverage and compliance certifications. See [Bright Data alternatives](/blog/brightdata-alternatives).

## 6. Octoparse — Best No-Code Scraping

Octoparse is a visual, point-and-click scraping tool. If you're leaving Apify because your team doesn't write code, Octoparse provides a GUI for building scrapers without programming.

### Pros

- Visual point-and-click interface — no coding required
- Template scrapers for popular websites
- Scheduled scraping with cloud execution
- Export to CSV, Excel, databases
- IP rotation built in

### Cons

- No REST API for programmatic access
- Desktop application required for scraper building
- No markdown output or AI-specific features
- Subscription pricing
- Limited customization compared to code-based tools
- Not suitable for AI agent integration

**Best for:** Non-technical teams that need data extraction without writing code.

## 7. Zyte — Best for E-Commerce Scraping

Zyte (formerly Scrapinghub) is the company behind Scrapy. They offer a managed scraping platform with automatic data extraction that's particularly strong for e-commerce — product pages, pricing, reviews. If Apify's e-commerce Actors aren't cutting it, Zyte's automatic extraction is worth evaluating.

### Pros

- Automatic data extraction — handles layout changes without reconfiguration
- Strong e-commerce extraction (products, prices, reviews)
- Built on Scrapy — mature crawl foundation
- Smart proxy rotation (Zyte Proxy Manager)
- API and Scrapy plugin interfaces

### Cons

- Per-request pricing
- Less flexible than general-purpose tools for non-e-commerce use cases
- No Firecrawl-compatible API
- No MCP server or AI agent integration
- Steeper learning curve for the full platform

**Best for:** Teams focused on e-commerce data extraction that need automatic handling of layout changes.

## Which Apify Alternative Should You Choose?

| Your Situation | Best Choice | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AI agent needs web access | **fastCRW** | Built-in MCP, low local-first latency (see [benchmark](/benchmarks)) |
| RAG pipeline: URL → markdown | **fastCRW** | Clean markdown conversion, lowest cost |
| Need screenshots + PDFs | **Firecrawl** | Most complete feature set |
| Cloudflare-protected JS-heavy SPAs | **Firecrawl Cloud** | Fire-engine anti-bot is the strongest story |
| Python extraction customization | **Crawl4AI** | Native Python hooks, chunking |
| Just need rendered HTML | **ScrapingBee** | Simplest API, managed proxies |
| Enterprise proxy network | **Bright Data** | 72M+ IPs, SOC 2 |
| No-code scraping | **Octoparse** | Visual interface, no coding |
| E-commerce data | **Zyte** | Automatic product extraction |
| Want zero vendor lock-in | **fastCRW** | Standard REST API, self-host free, Firecrawl-compatible on overlap surface |

## Self-Hosting vs Managed: The Cost Math

Apify charges based on compute units. For continuous scraping workloads, this adds up:

- **Apify:** A moderate workload (10,000 pages/day) costs roughly $49-149/month on their platform, depending on Actor complexity and compute needs. After the rental sunset, costs may shift further depending on which standard Actors you use.
- **fastCRW self-hosted:** The same workload runs on a $5-12/month VPS. fastCRW's tiny idle footprint means you can handle significant throughput on minimal hardware. AGPL-3.0 license — you pay for the server, not the software.
- **fastCRW Cloud:** 1000 free credits to start, then $69/mo Standard for 100k credits — generally cheaper than Apify for continuous workloads because there's no compute overhead.

The break-even point is low. If you're scraping more than a few hundred pages per day, self-hosting fastCRW (or moving to fastCRW Cloud) saves money immediately.

## Migrating off rental Actors — quick checklist

1. **Inventory rental Actor dependencies.** Check Apify Console → Actors → Filter by pricing model. Note which Actors are rental, who maintains them, and what they do (scrape a specific site, run a workflow, etc.).
2. **For each rental Actor, classify the migration path:** - Site-specific scraper (e.g., Amazon product) → either move to a maintainer's standalone service, or write the equivalent against fastCRW / Firecrawl using the site-specific selectors. - Generic crawler / mapper → move to fastCRW `/v1/crawl` or `/v1/map`. - LLM extraction Actor → fastCRW `/v1/scrape` with `formats: ["json"]` + JSON schema, or Firecrawl `/v1/extract`. - Workflow / dataset orchestration → Apify's standard pay-per-compute pricing still applies; or move the orchestration to your own scheduler (Cron, Airflow, Temporal) calling fastCRW.
3. **Estimate cost.** Compare projected fastCRW Cloud cost ($69/mo Standard for 100k credits) vs Apify standard pricing for the same workload. For most teams the migration pays for itself in 1-2 months.
4. **Pilot with 5% of traffic.** Run fastCRW alongside Apify for the highest-volume rental Actor first. Validate output parity before cutover.
5. **Cutover before the six-month deadline.** Don't wait. Pricing changes are a forcing function — better to migrate on your schedule than the vendor's.

## FAQ

### Can fastCRW replace Apify's Actor marketplace?

Not directly. fastCRW is a general-purpose scraping API — it scrapes any URL and returns markdown, HTML, or structured JSON, but it has no pre-built scrapers for specific sites. If you need Amazon product scrapers or LinkedIn profile extractors, Apify's marketplace (post-rental-sunset, on standard pay-per-compute) is still the faster path. For general AI scraping where you just need URL to clean content, fastCRW is simpler and cheaper.

### Is Crawlee a good Apify alternative?

Crawlee is Apify's own open-source framework — it's what Actors are built on. You can run Crawlee without the Apify platform and self-host your own scrapers. The trade-off is that you lose the marketplace, managed infrastructure, and datasets, but gain full control and zero platform fees. It's a good fit when you want a Node-native scraping framework and don't need an external API surface.

### Which Apify alternative is best for AI agents?

fastCRW. Its built-in MCP server gives an AI agent scrape, crawl, map, and search tools with zero configuration. No other tool in this comparison ships native MCP at that level out of the box. fastCRW also runs as a single static Rust binary in one container, so it's light enough to sit next to your agent workloads.

### Is fastCRW a drop-in replacement for Apify?

No. Apify's API design is different — different endpoints, a different Actor model, and its own Dataset and KeyValueStore concepts. fastCRW is Firecrawl-compatible, not Apify-compatible, so the migration is a rewrite of the integration layer rather than a base-URL swap. The good news is that most AI use cases use a small subset of Apify (run an Actor, get results), and that pattern maps cleanly to fastCRW's /v1/scrape and /v1/crawl.

### What is happening with the Apify rental Actor pricing change?

Apify announced on 14 April 2026 that it would sunset rental Actor pricing within six months. If your integration depends on rental-tier Actors whose maintainers aren't migrating to standard pay-per-compute, you have until roughly October 2026 to move. Teams in that position can rebuild on Apify's standard pricing, port to a maintainer's standalone service, or move to an alternative platform.

### How much does fastCRW cost compared to Apify at scale?

Self-hosting fastCRW is free under AGPL-3.0 — you pay only for your server, and a moderate workload runs on a $5–12/month VPS. fastCRW Cloud starts with 1000 free lifetime credits, then $69/mo on the Standard plan for 100,000 credits during launch pricing (which ends 2026-06-01). Apify's pay-per-compute model grows linearly with usage, so for continuous scraping workloads fastCRW is dramatically cheaper.
