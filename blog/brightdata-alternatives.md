## Short Answer

Bright Data is the largest proxy and scraping platform, but its enterprise pricing and complexity push many developer teams to look for alternatives. Here's the breakdown:

- **CRW** — Best developer-friendly alternative. Self-host for free under AGPL-3.0, Firecrawl-compatible API, built-in MCP server, local-first low latency. No proxy network needed for most AI scraping.
- **Firecrawl** — Best feature-complete scraping API with markdown output, screenshots, and structured extraction.
- **Apify** — Best managed platform with pre-built scrapers and Crawlee framework.
- **ScrapingBee** — Best simple rendering API with included proxy rotation.
- **Oxylabs** — Best enterprise proxy alternative with similar coverage at competitive pricing.
- **Zyte** — Best for e-commerce with automatic data extraction and smart proxies.
- **Crawl4AI** — Best free Python alternative for AI-focused extraction.

## Why Look for Bright Data Alternatives?

Bright Data has the largest proxy network in the industry (72M+ residential IPs) and a comprehensive scraping platform. But for many developer teams, it's not the right fit:

- **Enterprise pricing:** Minimum commitments, complex per-GB/per-request pricing, and costs that start in the hundreds per month. For most AI scraping workloads, this is overkill.
- **Complexity:** Multiple proxy types (residential, datacenter, mobile, ISP), a Web Scraper IDE, datasets marketplace, and SERP API. If you just need "URL → markdown," this is a lot of surface area to navigate.
- **No developer-first API:** Bright Data's API is designed for proxy management and large-scale data collection, not for the simple "give me clean content from this URL" pattern that AI developers need.
- **No self-hosting:** Fully managed platform. You can't run it on your own infrastructure.
- **No AI-native features:** No markdown output, no MCP server, no LLM extraction. AI teams need additional tooling on top.

*BYOP = Bring Your Own Proxy*

## 1. CRW — Best Developer-Friendly Alternative

[CRW](https://github.com/us/crw) takes the opposite approach from Bright Data. Instead of a massive platform with proxy networks and enterprise contracts, CRW is a single Rust binary that turns URLs into clean markdown via a simple REST API. For most AI and developer scraping use cases, this is all you need.

### Why CRW Over Bright Data

- **Free to self-host:** One Docker command, a single small static binary that runs on a $5/month VPS. No enterprise contracts, no per-GB fees.
- **Developer-first API:** Firecrawl-compatible REST API. `POST /v1/scrape` with a URL, get markdown back. That's it.
- **Built for AI:** Markdown output, structured JSON extraction, built-in MCP server for AI agents. Bright Data returns raw data — CRW returns LLM-ready content.
- **Local-first latency:** Run the engine next to your code with no proxy network overhead.
- **Firecrawl compatibility:** Existing Firecrawl SDKs, LangChain, and LlamaIndex integrations work by changing the base URL.
- **Operational simplicity:** One binary, no Redis, no Playwright, no browser to manage. Bright Data requires understanding proxy types, session management, and complex configuration.

### Where Bright Data Is Still Better

- **Proxy network:** 72M+ residential IPs. If your targets have aggressive geo-restrictions or IP-based blocking, Bright Data's network is unmatched. CRW supports proxies but doesn't include them.
- **Anti-bot at scale:** Enterprise-grade bot bypass for heavily protected sites (banking, ticketing, social media). CRW has stealth mode but can't match Bright Data's sophistication here.
- **Pre-built datasets:** Bright Data sells pre-collected datasets for common targets. Useful if you need data without running your own scraper.
- **Compliance:** SOC 2, GDPR compliance infrastructure, and enterprise legal support. Important for regulated industries.

**Best for:** Developer teams building AI agents, RAG pipelines, or content extraction workflows that don't need enterprise proxy networks.

## 2. Firecrawl — Best Feature-Complete Scraping API

Firecrawl is the most feature-rich scraping API available. If you're leaving Bright Data because you want a simpler, developer-focused tool but still need features like screenshots and PDF parsing, Firecrawl is the natural landing spot.

### Pros

- Complete feature set: markdown, screenshots, PDFs, structured extraction
- Self-hosted option (AGPL-3.0) — eliminate per-page fees
- Mature SDKs in Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust
- Good anti-bot handling out of the box
- Active development, regular releases

### Cons

- Higher per-request latency than a local-first engine
- Self-hosting requires Redis, Playwright, and a heavier runtime
- No included proxy network (same as CRW — bring your own)
- Hosted pricing per page

**Best for:** Teams that need a complete scraping API with browser features and are okay with higher latency. [CRW vs Firecrawl comparison](/blog/firecrawl-vs-crawl4ai-vs-crw).

## 3. Apify — Best Managed Scraping Platform

Apify is the closest managed platform alternative to Bright Data, but at a lower price point and with a stronger developer focus. Pre-built scrapers, managed infrastructure, and the open-source Crawlee framework give you Bright Data-style capabilities without enterprise minimums.

**Best for:** Teams that want managed scraping at a lower price point than Bright Data. [Apify alternatives](/blog/apify-alternatives).

## 4. ScrapingBee — Best Simple Rendering API

ScrapingBee provides a simple rendering API with included proxy rotation. If you're leaving Bright Data because you just need rendered HTML from a simple endpoint, ScrapingBee strips away the complexity.

### Pros

- Extremely simple API — send URL, get rendered HTML
- Proxy rotation and CAPTCHA solving included
- No infrastructure to manage
- Screenshot support
- Lower price point than Bright Data

### Cons

- Raw HTML output, no markdown

**Best for:** Enterprise teams evaluating proxy providers and wanting competitive bids against Bright Data.

## 6. Zyte — Best for E-Commerce Extraction

Zyte (formerly Scrapinghub) provides automatic data extraction with a focus on e-commerce. If you're using Bright Data to scrape product data, Zyte's automatic extraction handles layout changes without manual parser updates — a significant operational advantage.

### Pros

- Automatic product, article, and listing extraction
- Handles site layout changes without reconfiguration
- Built on Scrapy — battle-tested crawl infrastructure
- Smart proxy rotation (Zyte Proxy Manager)
- Lower entry price than Bright Data for targeted use cases

## Do You Actually Need a Proxy Network?

One important question before choosing a Bright Data alternative: do you actually need a proxy network?

Bright Data's core product is proxies. But many teams use Bright Data for scraping when they don't actually need 72M+ IPs. Here's a quick assessment:

- **You probably don't need proxies if:** You're scraping public content (news, docs, blogs), building RAG pipelines from publicly accessible pages, or your AI agent needs to read web pages on demand.
- **You probably need proxies if:** Your targets aggressively block IPs, you need geo-specific content, you're scraping at very high volume from single domains, or you're targeting sites with strict rate limits.

If you don't need proxies, tools like CRW, Firecrawl, or Crawl4AI give you better scraping features at a fraction of the cost. CRW's stealth mode and [Cloudflare challenge retry](/blog/bypass-cloudflare-scraping) handle many anti-bot scenarios without a proxy network.

## Cost Comparison for Developer Teams

Bright Data's pricing starts high and scales with usage. Here's how alternatives compare for a typical developer workload:

- **Bright Data:** $500+/month minimum for proxy access + data collection.
- **Oxylabs:** $99+/month — more accessible enterprise pricing.
- **Apify:** $49/month for the starter plan.
- **ScrapingBee:** $49/month for 1,000 credits.
- **CRW self-hosted:** $5/month (VPS). Zero per-request fees. No proxy cost if you don't need proxies.
- **fastCRW cloud:** 1000 free credits to start, then usage-based.
- **Crawl4AI self-hosted:** $12/month (VPS). Free software.
- **Firecrawl self-hosted:** $12-24/month (VPS with enough RAM).

For developer teams that don't need enterprise proxy networks, self-hosted CRW is the most cost-effective option by a wide margin.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can CRW match Bright Data's anti-bot capabilities?

Not fully. Bright Data's proxy network and enterprise bot-bypass are unmatched for heavily protected sites. CRW's stealth mode handles Cloudflare challenges and basic bot detection, and you can configure external proxies for additional coverage. For most AI scraping of public content, CRW's built-in capabilities are sufficient.

### Is Oxylabs better than Bright Data?

They're comparable. Oxylabs claims a larger IP pool (100M+) and often offers more competitive pricing. The best choice depends on your specific targets, required geo-coverage, and negotiated pricing. Both are enterprise-grade proxy providers.

### What's the cheapest way to do AI web scraping?

Self-host CRW on a $5/month VPS. You get a Firecrawl-compatible API, markdown output, and a built-in MCP server — all for a fixed monthly cost with no per-request fees. [Full guide: CRW on a $5 VPS](/blog/crw-on-5-dollar-vps).
