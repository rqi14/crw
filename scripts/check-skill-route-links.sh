# Mechanical guard against two drift classes in skills/ content:
#
#   1. MISSING SKILL: an `npx skills add us/crw@<name>` install line names a
#      skill directory (skills/<name>/) that does not exist.
#   2. DEAD ROUTE: a documented `METHOD /path`, or a bare `/v1`, `/v2` or
#      `/firecrawl` path named in backticks with no method attached (e.g. a
#      sentence mentioning "POST to `/v1/crawl`"), names an HTTP path that is
#      not registered in the axum router.
#
# Route ground truth is exactly crates/crw-server/src/routes/v1/mod.rs and
# routes/v2/mod.rs (each also mounted verbatim under /firecrawl by
# crates/crw-server/src/app.rs), nothing else. Route families outside v1/v2
# (e.g. /mcp, /health, /metrics) are out of scope for this check, so a mention
# of one of those is never flagged.
#
# A `METHOD /path` mention on a line that explicitly says the endpoint does
# NOT exist ("Not implemented", "no equivalent", ...) is the doc correctly
# describing an absence, not a false claim, and is skipped.
#
# `/v1/monitor*` is allowlisted outright: docs/docs/monitoring.md documents it
# (with its own base URL, https://fastcrw.com/api) as a SaaS-only
# control-plane feature that deliberately ships no route in crw-server's
# router, a real cross-repo architectural split, not doc drift. If that split
# ever changes, drop the allowlist entry in the same commit that adds the
# route to routes/v1/mod.rs.
#
# Skips gracefully (does not fail CI) if the router source files are absent.
#
# Portable: bash + python3.
