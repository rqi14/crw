"""Render the 3-way benchmark panel as a self-contained SVG.

The figure is generated from the numbers below, not drawn by hand, so a reader
can trace every value to the run of record and regenerate the image when the
benchmark is rerun.

Source of record: bench/server-runs/RESULT_3WAY_1000_FULL.md (2026-05-08,
Firecrawl's public scrape-content-dataset-v1, 1,000 URLs / 819 labeled,
concurrency 5, timeout 120s, recall mode). Download sizes: BENCHMARKS.md.

Deliberately absent: p90/p99. fastCRW's recall-mode p90 (14157 ms) is the worst
of the three, and no other p90 for this engine has ever been measured. Any p90
on this panel would have to come from a run that does not exist.
