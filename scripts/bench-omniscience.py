"""Renders the AA-Omniscience answer-accuracy strip in .github/benchmarks/.

Deliberately a SEPARATE figure from bench-radar.svg rather than a sixth axis on
it. The radar's five axes all come from one run of Firecrawl's public 1,000-URL
scrape dataset, with all three tools through the same matcher, and its caption
says exactly that. This is a different dataset, a different harness and a
different task, so putting it on the same polygon would make that caption false.
Crawl4AI is also absent here for a real reason rather than an oversight: it is a
scraper, not a search API, so it is not on the Artificial Analysis board at all
and there is no honest value to plot for it.

Numbers: fastCRW is our own run over all 600 questions, in a rebuild of
Artificial Analysis's published harness, validated by running a listed provider
through the same rebuild and reproducing its published score to within 1.5
points. Every other row is that provider's published score on the public board.
